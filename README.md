# fgp-timesheets

This repository contains 3 seperate scripts made for creating and managing timesheets:

- `report.py` for reporting on bulk timesheets
- `sheet.py` for generating complex timesheets from cli
- `clock.py` for generating simple timesheets from cli

Usage information is contained within these scripts, these are developed and tested on MacOS with no guarantee of function outside of it.
